    caption:" 1. Island of the Dolls",
    info:[`When it comes to exploring the weirdest places in the world, among all the list comes 
    this crazy island in south of Mexico City in the Xochimlco channels.`,
    `While the surrounding area is well populated, the island is largely deserted, save for 
    hundreds of roughed-up dolls hanging in the trees and buildings covered with cobwebs and insects.
    The sight looks like just out of a horror movie.`,`
    The Island of the Dolls, Isla de las Muñecas, as it's called in Spanish, was originally 
    owned by Don Julián Santana Barrera and named during the 1950s when he began 
    to hang them as protection against evil spirits. `,
    `According to legend, a young girl drowned entangled among the lilies of the canal.
     Santana began to experience inexplicable situations so, terrified, placed dolls that
     he found in the garbage of the canals of Cuemanco with the idea that they would scare 
    the soul of the young girl.
    When the owner of the island died, he was in the same place where he saw the girl die.`,
    `The island of the dolls is an hour and a half from Embarcadero Cuemanco. The only access
    by boat (trajinera). Most rowers are willing to transport people to the island, but there 
    are those who refuse due to superstitions.`,
    `In addition to hundreds of dolls, the island also contains a small museum with some articles
    from local newspapers about the island and the previous owner. There are a store and three 
    rooms, one of which seems to have been used as a bedroom. In this room is the first and favorite 
    doll that Santana collected named Agustinita.`,
    `Some of the visitors place offerings around this doll in exchange for miracles and blessings,
    some others change their clothes and maintain it as a form of worship.
    Tourists often make a trip to this place during the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico.`],

    caption: " 2. The Rat temple",
    info: [`Karni Mata Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Karni Mata at Deshnoke,
    30 km from Bikaner, in Rajasthan, India. It is also known as the Temple of Rats.`,
    `The Goddess Karna Mata was a female Hindu warrior sage born in the Charan caste.
    She lived an ascetic life and was widely revered during her own lifetime.
    She lived to be 150 years old and remained young and beautiful.`, 
    `Legend has it that Laxman, son of Karni Mata , drowned in a pond in Kapil Sarovar 
    in Kolayat Tehsil while he was attempting to drink from it. Karni Mata implored Yama,
    the god of death, to revive him. First refusing, Yama eventually relented, permitting 
    Laxman and all of Karni Mata's male children to be reincarnated as rats.`,
   `These holy rodents are revered by their followers as the Charan People believe that the rats 
    of Temple are their ancestors.`,
    `The followers of the Charan believe that once they die, they too will be reincarnated as a 
    rat and subsequently, when a rat dies, it will be reincarnated as a human again.`,
    `Out of all of the thousands of rats in the temple, there are a few white rats, which are 
    considered to be especially holy. They are believed to be the manifestations of Karni Mata 
    herself and her four sons. Sighting them is a special blessing.`,
    `The temple is opened to the public early in the morning at 04:00. Charan priests perform 
    Mangla-Aarti and offer bhog (special food) in worship. Devotees make offerings to the rats,including
     cheese and sweets. There are also bowls of milk around the temple for the rats to enjoy.`,
     `Many worshipers believe the rats' saliva has healing properties and will share food and 
     milk with the rats.`,
     `Despite the fact that rats are considered diseases carrier, apparently the Karni Mata temple
      has never had an outbreak of disease so, even during the worst of the plague, the town of
    Deshnok was not affected.`]

    info: [`The Capuchin Catacombs are burial catacombs in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. 
    The conservation status of the countless corpses exposed make the cemetery of the Convent of 
    the Capuchin Friars one of the most impressive places to visit in the world.`,
     `In the 1600s, the cemetery overseen by the Capuchin monks was full. Instead of expanding 
     the traditional burial grounds, when Brother Silvestro of Gubbio died, the monks decided 
     to excavate the crypts below the cemetery and mummified him so they could continue to be 
     and pray with him.`,
     `Initially the catacombs were intended only for deceased friars.
     However, in later centuries it became a status symbol to be entombed in the Capuchin catacombs
     so they decided to expand and offer this type of burial to residents of Palermo who could afford it.`,
     `In their wills, local luminaries would ask to be preserved in certain clothes, or even have 
     their clothes changed at regular intervals. 
     Priests wore their clerical vestments, while others were clothed according to contemporary
     fashion. Relatives would visit to pray for the deceased and to maintain the body in presentable 
     condition.`,
     `The catacombs were maintained through donations from the relatives of the deceased. 
     Each new body was placed in a temporary niche and later placed into a more permanent location.
      So long as contributions continued, the body remained in it's proper place but if relatives 
      stopped sending money, the body was put aside on a shelf until they resumed payments.`],
